# projectX backend terminologies

**Toil** - is an open-source pure-Python workflow engine that lets people write better pipelines.

**Container** - is a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

**DAG** - A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a conceptual representation of a series of activities. The order of the activities is depicted by a graph, which is visually presented as a set of circles, each one representing an activity, some of which are connected by lines, which represent the flow from one activity to another. Each circle is known as a “vertex” and each line is known as an “edge.” “Directed” means that each edge has a defined direction, so each edge necessarily represents a single directional flow from one vertex to another. “Acyclic” means that there are no loops (i.e., “cycles”) in the graph, so that for any given vertex, if you follow an edge that connects that vertex to another, there is no path in the graph to get back to that initial vertex.

**API** - API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

**AWS** - AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services
