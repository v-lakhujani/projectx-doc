# Biological/Bioinformatics Terms

- **Base/Nucleotide** : A, T, G, C, N
- Sequence	 - is an ordered list of bases. For example: A T A G C A T C A C T A C T A C A C T A
- Sequencing - is a technology to determine the sequence. Sequencing is performed by a machine called sequencer.
- Sequencing data - is the data produced after a run is finished. This data is stored in binary format in BCL files.
- Chromosome(chr) - is a set of sequence(s). Chr 1 to 22, X and Y
- Genome -  is a collection of chromosomes. Genomes have different versions called “build”.
- Location - is a set coordinate of sequence/base/variant. Location is defined by chr, start and stop coordinate.
- Variant - is a change of base(s) at a specific location of a sequence as compared to a reference.
- Reference - is a genome used as a control for comparison.
- Annotation - is an attribute of a variant explaining details about it.
- Demultiplexing -	is a process by which the sequencing data (BCL files) are sorted according to the samples.
- IGV - Integrative genomics viewer is a tool to visualise the BAM/VCF/BED files.
